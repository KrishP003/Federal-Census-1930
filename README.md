# Federal-Census-1930
The Federal Census program is designed to process real federal census data stored in a file and organize individuals based on their respective streets of residence. The program reads the data from the file and performs the following tasks:

Data Input: The program accesses a real file containing federal census data, which includes information about individuals such as their names, addresses, and other relevant details.

Street Segregation: The program segregates the individuals based on the streets they live on. It identifies unique street names from the data and groups individuals accordingly.

Alphabetical Sorting: For each street, the program sorts the individuals in alphabetical order based on their first and last names. This ensures that individuals on the same street are organized in a logical and easily accessible manner.

Output Generation: Finally, the program generates an output that displays the individuals split by their respective streets and organized alphabetically. This output could be in the form of a new file, a printed report, or any other suitable format for easy reference and analysis.
